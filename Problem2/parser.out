Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . start
    (1) start -> . Tap
    (2) start -> . Cling
    (3) start -> . Clink
    (4) start -> . Drip
    (5) start -> . Whack

    Tap             shift and go to state 1
    Cling           shift and go to state 4
    Clink           shift and go to state 5
    Drip            shift and go to state 2
    Whack           shift and go to state 6

    start                          shift and go to state 3
